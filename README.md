The ERP Blazor Management System is a modular and scalable enterprise application developed with Blazor Server using a clean layered architecture. Blazor Server was specifically chosen because Blazor cannot directly connect to SQL databases from the client, and a secure server-side execution model was required for data access and business logic. The system includes structured modules for company management, product definitions, orders, and configuration processes, all built on a clear separation of concerns between the UI, Service Layer, and Data Layer. This architecture ensures maintainability, security, and high performance while providing a modern, component-based user interface. The project is easy to extend with new ERP modules and offers a solid foundation for enterprise-level development.
